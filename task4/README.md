# Step 1: Potential Issues in the Service File
1. Log Redirection:
The StandardOutput and StandardError directives use append:. However, systemd does not support this syntax. Instead, you can use File: or specify the log file paths directly.

Issue: StandardOutput=append:/var/log/http-server.log
Fix: StandardOutput=File:/var/log/http-server.log

2. Log File Access Permissions:
The service runs under the serkan user. However, accessing /var/log/ requires elevated permissions, which could cause issues.

3. Node.js Binary and Script Path:
The /usr/bin/node binary path may not be accurate. Use which node to verify its location. Additionally, confirm that the server.js file exists and is executable.

4. Working Directory:
The specified WorkingDirectory (/home/serkan/Projects/konzek/server) should be checked to ensure it contains the required files.

## Step 2: Fixing the Service File

```s
[Unit]
Description=Node.js HTTP Server
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /home/user/Projects/konzek/server/server.js
Restart=always
User=user
Group=user
Environment=NODE_ENV=production
WorkingDirectory=/home/user/Projects/konzek/server

# Redirect standard output and error to journal logs
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

# StandardOutput=File:/home/user/http-server.log
# StandardError=File:/home/user/http-server-error.log

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
## Step 3: Troubleshooting Log
### Inspection and Analysis:

Used systemctl status http-server.service to inspect the current state. Found the following issues in logs:
append: is an invalid directive in systemd.
Permission denied for /var/log/http-server.log.

### Binary and File Validation:

```bash
which node
ls -l /home/user/Projects/konzek/server/server.js
```
### Fixing Permission Issues:

*  Changed log file paths to be under the serkan user's home directory.
* Created the log files and set appropriate permissions:

```bash
sudo touch /home/serkan/http-server.log
sudo chmod 664 /home/serkan/http-server.log
```

### Restarting the Service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart http-server.service
```

### Verifying the Fix:  

```bash
sudo systemctl status http-server.service
journalctl -u http-server.service
```
